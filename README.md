# EversisTask

This is my solution for eversis's frontend task.

## To start with

To install all dependencies through npm, that command will be helpful
```
npm install
```
## Run server

To run server in development mode, just use command `ng serve`. 
Every command should be run in working folder.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Technologies

* Angular 9+
* Bootstrap
* SCSS
